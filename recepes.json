      "ingredients": [
        "200g spaghetti",
        "100g pancetta",
        "2 large eggs",
        "50g pecorino cheese",
        "50g parmesan cheese",
        "Freshly ground black pepper",
        "Salt",
        "2 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole",
        "50g unsalted butter"
      ],
      "method": [
        "Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.",
        "Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind.",
        "Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper, and set everything aside.",
        "Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti, and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente.",
        "Squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.",
        "While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic.",
        "Drop the butter into a large frying pan or wok, add the pancetta and garlic, and cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic is there to flavor the pancetta.",
        "Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.",
        "Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated.",
        "Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy. Season with a little salt, if needed.",
        "Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta onto the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper."
